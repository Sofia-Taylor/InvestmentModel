    "### 1.1 Background and Contribution ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Electric power lines can ignite wildfires when an electric fault occurs. Power line faults arise through multiple mechanisms, including contact with vegetation or animals, downed towers and lines, and equipment malfunctions. High-energy fault currents can lead to arcing and sparking, which can ignite a fire under hot and dry conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several methods that are currently implemented to mitigate the wildfire ignition risk from power lines. On a shorter-term (operation) time horizon, it is possible to de-energize lines in high fire risk areas in what is known as a \"public safety power shutoff\". If there is no current in a power line, then there is no chance for a fault to occur. While these power shutoffs are effective in mitigating fire risk, they can result in power outages, which are particularly harmful for people that rely on electrically-powered medical devices and socially vulnerable populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a longer-term (planning) time horizon, grid owners can conduct vegetation management, replace aging components, and convert overhead lines to underground cables. These upgrades, especially undergrounding lines, are expensive, so it is important to prioritize lines that exhibit the highest risk of igniting a fire. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I propose an optimization-based method to choose lines for upgrade so that wildfire risk, upgrade costs, and load shed due to power shutoffs are minimized throughout an electric grid. This is a challenging problem because we must include constraints to represent how power flows throughout an electric grid. When considering multiple scenarios, the problem becomes large. Further, we must make a relaxation (via a McCormick envelope) in the power flow formulation to make the problem convex and linear. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Data and Scenarios ###\n",
    "\n",
    "The wildfire risk of each line in an electric grid is quantified using wildfire risk maps, specifically the Wildland Fire Potential Index ([WFPI](https://www.usgs.gov/fire-danger-forecast/wildland-fire-potential-index-wfpi?msclkid=6007b855d07511ec9923099beeaceb51)) from the US Geological Survey. The WFPI contains indices from 0 to 150 that represent the relative wildfire potential in an area due to natural (not power-specific) factors. The WFPI maps are published once daily, and the map for June 6, 2021 is shown in Fig. 1. \n",

    "\n",
    "This problem requires wildfire risk values for each line in an electric grid. The power system model that is used is the Reliability Test System from the Grid Modernization Lab Consortium ([RTS-GMLC](https://github.com/GridMod/RTS-GMLC?msclkid=41650ba3d07511ec8bb3deb3607abde1)), which is a synthetic grid model with an artificial location in the southwestern United States. Fig. 2 shows the RTS overlaid on a WFPI map.\n",

    "\n",
    "For this project, the risk of each power line is computed as the maximum intersecting WFPI value. The assignments are made using ArcGIS Pro, a mapping software application. For more information on this risk assignment, please refer to [this arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07348?msclkid=7ce57b87d07511ec8fe4c203cf031cfc). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since wildfire risk varies over time, it is important to consider multiple days (or scenarios) of wildfire risk. Therefore, the proposed model selects a set of lines to upgrade such that wildfire risk and load shed due to power shutoffs across multiple scenarios are minimized. In reality, load also varies over time, but the load is assumed to be constant for the purposes of this project, and load data can be added in future development. \n",
    "\n",
    "One challenge of considering multiple scenarios is that the size of the problem (i.e. number of variables and constraints) becomes large. To illustrate how this model works while still keeping the run time low, only XX scenarios are used in this example."

    "As outlined below, the optimization problem has a linear objective function, linear constraints, bound constraints, and integrality constraints, making it a mixed integer linear program (MILP).\n",

    "### 2.4 Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "To define the wildfire risk $\\rho_k$ in each scenario $k$, we need to use the risk parameters $\\boldsymbol{R}_{l,k}$ in addition to the upgrade and shutoff decision variables, $z^{upgrade}_l$ and $z^{on}_{l,k}$, respectively. We want to describe three cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the line is upgraded (i.e. it is an underground line), then the wildfire risk is zero, regardless of the shutoff status.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the line is not upgraded (i.e. it is an overhead line) and the line is turned off, then the wildfire risk is zero.\n",

    "3. If the line is not upgraded and the line is on, then the wildfire risk is a non-zero value equal to the assigned WFPI value.\n",

We can see that many lines are selected for upgrade in this case, but we could reduce this by scaling the terms in the objective function to either more heavily weight upgrade costs or less heavily weight wildfire risk. The results are very sensitive to the choice of tradeoff parameters. In order to use this model to make grid planning decisions, one might want to sweep the tradeoff parameter values to examine which parameters (and thus which solution points) result in favorable levels of the three objects. The creation of such a tradeoff plot is a task that will be completed in future work. \n",

    "## 5. Conclusion ##\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed model selects power lines to upgrade to reduce wildfire ignition risk, load shed due to public safety power shutoffs, and the cost of line upgrade investments. One strength of this model is that it utilitizes wildfire potential maps to estimate the potential for a power line to start a fire. To capture variability in wildfire potential, the model selects upgrades that are optimal across multiple scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation of this work is that the risk values obtained from the WFPI maps only represent the wildfire potential of the line's location, and do not represent the likelihood of an electric fault. Instead, we assume this probability is constant across the system. Another limitation is that load variability is not captured in this example, so incorporating this load data is an area for future work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key challenge with this work is that it does not seem to scale well. In this report, only 10 scenarios are used in the solution because greater numbers result in a very long run time. This is likely due to the large number of variables and constraints that are needed for each scenario. Another area of future work is to try to reduce the problem size. One option for this that is currently in development is to utilize clustering to generate a small set of representative wildfire risk scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be interesting to extend this problem in several directions. One option is to consider the uncertainty in the wildfire risk values through stochastic optimization. Another direction is to incorporate the potential for other grid assets (such as distributed energy resources and microgrid capabilities) to reduce wildfire risk and load shed due to power shutoffs.
